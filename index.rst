=============================

The Block Network is a set of infrastructure for building a decentralized Internet.
It is a distributed extensible virtual network,
based on the physical network layer and the ISP network layer.

Block Network uses blockchain technology, distributed networks and asymmetric encryption,
provides distributed services such as Proxy/VPN,
multi-layer anonymous network, IM, DNS, even CDN and DDoS defense, etc.

The block with stable value scale will be used in
the entire ecology and produce an incentive effect.
Everyone can participate in distributed network construction.
We believe the Block Network will make the future Internet
more open, more equal, more stable, more efficient, safer and freer.
